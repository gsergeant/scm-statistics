Advanced statistical methods for characterizing single-cell migration

This repository was originally intented to be turned into a Bioconductor R package, which is why it has some of the structure and files associated with it.
I realised cell migration analysis is too diverse in both dataset and feature namespace and design to create a one-size-fits-all statistical analysis pipeline.
Instead I have chosen to keep my analysis tryouts and troubles in their original script form here, along with all data, and will create a separate repository for publishing purposes with the relevant datasets and analysis code.
